## Fitting In

Today, I changed my project site stylesheet to better match the styles of the Jekyll theme that I chose so that going between them is not quite so jarring. I added a banner image and changed some of the colors.

## How It Started

## Splash Page

I added a splash page a few days ago. No, it really doesn't match the project pages.

## And Now

Yes, I need to take some design classes.
