## Things Learned So Far

- Markdown is easy, except it's not.
- Jekyll is hard, and everything else is a lie.
- Ruby is simple, but not on a Mac.
- Linux is ugly, and now so is Windows 11.
- Atom is awesome, unless you can't type or spell.
- VS Code is clunky, but boy is it powerful.
- Git's learning curve is steep but worth it.
- GitHub is pretty and has an octocat.
