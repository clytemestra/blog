So, why GitHub? What does GitHub have to do with these text editors I've been going on about? What is GitHub, even? Well, actually, it all starts with Git.

Git is what ordinary people with Word files with names like `project_v7_final_final.docx` don't know they wish they had. Unfortunately, Git can't do what it does on wrapped files like Word files. It only works with plain text and code files. And on the command line (mostly). Git tracks changes to files, allows you to recover old versions of files, and generally makes editing your project safe and manageable, all without making a single change to the file name or enclosing folder nameâ€”with multiple contributors and visual comparisons available. All you need to do is make a repository for your project and then commit your file changes periodically. Git handles the rest.

This is where GitHub comes in. GitHub is a cloud-based storage and management solution for Git repositories. Do you need GitHub for Git to work? No. Do you want to use GitHub anyway, especially if you're working with a team? Yes! GitHub provides an easy-to-use interface and a multitude of project management tools. The first part of that last sentence is the most important for the hobbyist, who might otherwise be at the mercy of the command line alone. Another great feature of GitHub for hobbyists who want to distribute their projects is the ease with which files can be shared and entire repositories cloned. (There are release and packaging tools for those who have need.)

GitHub also makes it possible to publish static web pages via GitHub Pages. This feature is what sealed the deal for me. I don't want to just fiddle with HTML and CSS: I want my creations to see the light of day!

Disclaimer: This brief explainer is aimed at hobbyists, particularly hobbyists from humanities backgrounds.
