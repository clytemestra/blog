Yesterday, I added not one but two slideshows to [Seeds of Knowledge](https://clytemestra.github.io). First, I added a slideshow of eight photos of Isis and Sasha on automatic, which I loved. But then I got it into my head that I also wanted a slideshow of some of my favorite creepy dolls on the same page, so I had to drop the automatic transitions.

I can't say that I really knew what I was doing, but eventually, I had everything working correctly. My level of JavaScript knowledge is that of finding something interesting and recreating it while learning a few basic things in the process.

I'm hoping that between _The Object-Oriented Thought Process_ and _JavaScript and JQuery_ I will actually understand some of this stuff eventually.
