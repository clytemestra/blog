There's not much to report. Life, stress, and three jobs have interrupted my fun for February, at least. I have made incremental changes, tweaking things here and there. I changed the intro page to include tiles for all of my pages. I added a sample page for the AWS Blog posts that I've copyedited and have been published so far. There should be more to come, as I was very busy editing AWS Storage Blog posts this month. That has slowed down, and the main job should be less understaffed soon, so maybe March will bring more progress.
