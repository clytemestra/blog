## This Blog

GitHub dared me to start a blog, so here it is. I'm trying to learn HTML, CSS, and maybe JavaScript, but I keep getting interrupted by learning things like Git, GitHub, Jekyll, and Ruby. I tried to do all this on Linux, but it kept crashing, so I'm hoping I don't break my Mac.

This blog tracks my learning odyssey from Atom to infinity. You can witness the results of my floundering on the project site, [Seeds of Knowledge](https://clytemestra.github.io).

## Fred

I am a technical editor in the field of emergency management. I also freelance copyedit education materials and cloud computing blog posts. I have a husband who codes and two cats who loaf around a lot. I get bored easily, and it tends to get me in trouble.
