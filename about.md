## Me

My name is Fred. I am a technical editor in the field of emergency management. I also freelance copyedit education materials and cloud computing blog posts. I have a husband who codes and two cats who loaf around a lot. Together, we have a house that needs lots of repairs, but it's our first house, so we're not sure how normal that is.

## This Blog

GitHub dared me to start a blog, so here it is. I'm trying to learn HTML, CSS, and maybe JavaScript, but I keep getting interrupted by learning things like Git, GitHub, Jekyll, and Ruby. I tried to do all this on Linux, but it kept crashing, so I'm hoping I don't break my Mac.

I posted the first few write-ups of my learning experiences so far on my WordPress blog, but they don't really belong there. So, voila. Coming soon. Whatever.
